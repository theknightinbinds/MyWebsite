Code written by Joseph McCallum-Nattrass, a small amount from Eric Weinstein on codecademy's course CSS: An overview and 1 
line was given to me by twitter to emmbed my personal timeline. I am using twitter as a way of posting until I have a 
php based posting system(kinda like a blog without comments). But my priority is to get the downloads up(after I make
something worth of uploading).

This is a website to host the links to all my projects, keep updated with me and is to serve as a professional webpage for
my future career.

Feel free to copy and take.
